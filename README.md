# House_Price_Prediction_NN

This is NN which purpose is to predict house price based on data hosted on Kaggle. Here I continue to learn PyTorch,
practice in the Data Processing and also I'm trying to improve accuracy of my model by changing features/hyperparameters/NN architecture.

So far my Kaggle score is: 0.16287
